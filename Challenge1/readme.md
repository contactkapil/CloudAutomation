## Design and Deployment of 3 tier architecture in azure using terraform.

### Challenge1 

Develop 3 tier architecture on public cloud platform.

## What is three-tier architecture?
Three-tier architecture is a well-established software application architecture that organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers: the presentation tier, or user interface; the application tier, where data is processed; and the data tier, where the data associated with the application is stored and managed.

## What is terraform?
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.

## Installation
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## Pre requisite to build the solution
- Azure  subscription.
- Azure service principle 
- Terraform open source installed ,azure CLI /powershell

## Architecture of solution to be deployed
